title: "About"

I'm Carl Andersson, a DevOps/SRE engineer based in Sweden. I spend my days automating infrastructure, wrangling Kubernetes clusters, and evangelizing NixOS to anyone who will listen.

## Background

I got into tech through the classic route of breaking things and figuring out how to fix them. Started with Linux in my teens, moved through sysadmin roles, and eventually found my calling in the space between development and operations.

## What I Do

Most of my work involves making systems more reliable, deployments more predictable, and on-call rotations less painful. I believe in infrastructure as code, immutable deployments, and the power of a well-configured Nix flake.

## Outside of Work

When I'm not staring at terminals, I enjoy tinkering with home automation, contributing to open source projects, and occasionally touching grass.
