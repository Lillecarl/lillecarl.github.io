Welcome. I'm Carl Andersson AKA lillecarl, a DevOps/Site Reliability engineer.

If care enough that you made it here you might wonder, what the shiet is "lillecarl" about!? Yes it translates to "little carl", no funny translation pun or anything.
I got the nickname when i was in preschool, there were two Carls in the neighborhood i grew up in and I was the youngest... My artistic creativity stops there.

It stuck because switching usernames is a PITA and I haven't come up with something better. xXx_DragonSlayer9001UwU_xXx was on the table but it's annoying to type so lillecarl (LilleCarl) it is.

The profile picture is [Ernst Kirchteiger](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Kirchsteiger) AKA Mys Ernst (Cozy Ernst). I admire a man who sports being barefoot on TV.
