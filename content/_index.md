title: "lillecarl"

Welcome. I'm Carl Andersson AKA lillecarl, a DevOps/Site Reliability engineer.

If care enough that you made it here you might wonder, what the shiet is "lillecarl" about!? Tes it translates literally to "little carl", no funny translation pun or anything.
I got the nickname when i was in preschool, there were two Carls in the neighborhood i grew up in and I was the youngest. My artistic creativity stops there, it stuck because
switching usernames is a PITA and I haven't come up with something else. xXx_DragonSlayer9001_xXx was on the table but it's annoying to type so lillecarl (Actually LilleCarl) it is!
