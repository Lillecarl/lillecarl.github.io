After running Kubernetes clusters in production for several years, here are some lessons that weren't obvious from the documentation.

## Resource Limits Are Not Optional

Every pod needs resource requests and limits. Every single one. That "small utility container" will eventually OOM your node at 3 AM if you don't constrain it.

## Node Autoscaling Is Tricky

Cloud provider autoscalers work, but they're slow. Plan for burst capacity, and don't assume scaling will happen fast enough for sudden traffic spikes.

## GitOps Is Worth the Setup

Tools like ArgoCD or Flux add complexity upfront, but having your cluster state in Git with automatic sync is invaluable. No more "who ran kubectl apply" mysteries.

## Observability First

Set up proper logging, metrics, and tracing before you need them. Debugging a production issue without observability is like fixing a car engine blindfolded.

## Keep It Simple

Not every problem needs a service mesh. Not every app needs horizontal pod autoscaling. Start simple, add complexity only when you have a specific problem to solve.

## The Ecosystem Changes Fast

What's best practice today might be deprecated tomorrow. Stay current, but don't chase every new tool. Boring technology has its merits.

These lessons came from real incidents and late nights. Hopefully they save someone else some pain.
