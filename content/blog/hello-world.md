Finally got around to setting up a proper website. Built with Hugo, deployed via GitHub Actions, styled to be as minimal as possible.

## Why Bother?

A little portfolio bullshitty thingy can be useful when selling yourself online, and if I ever decide to write something
that isn't code I don't want to lock it behind some evil megacorporations ad network (The hypocracy is strong with this one using
GitHub pages but at least the content isn't in some proprietary format).

## What to Expect

Mostly technical content - infrastructure, DevOps, NixOS, that sort of thing. Occasional opinions. Infrequent updates, probably.

## The Stack

- **Hugo** for static site generation
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **GitHub Actions** for deployment
- Custom minimal theme because I don't need much

No JavaScript frameworks were harmed in the making of this site. Just some vanilla JS for the theme toggle.
