# Placeholder AI slop
Don't read this

Finally got around to setting up a proper website. Built with Hugo, deployed via GitHub Actions, styled to be as minimal as possible.

## Why Bother?

A few reasons:
- Somewhere to dump technical notes that might help others
- A place to point people when they ask about my background
- An excuse to play with Hugo and static site generators

## What to Expect

Mostly technical content - infrastructure, DevOps, NixOS, that sort of thing. Occasional opinions. Infrequent updates, probably.

## The Stack

- **Hugo** for static site generation
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **GitHub Actions** for deployment
- Custom minimal theme because I don't need much

No JavaScript frameworks were harmed in the making of this site. Just some vanilla JS for the theme toggle.
